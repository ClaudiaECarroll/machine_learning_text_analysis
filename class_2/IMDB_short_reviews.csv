"one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode you ' ll be hooked. they are right, as this is exactly what happened with me. < br / > < br / > the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence, which set in right from the word go. trust me, this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid. this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs, sex or violence. its is hardcore, in the classic use of the word. < br / > < br / > it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary. it focuses mainly on emerald city, an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards, so privacy is not high on the agenda. em city is home to many.. aryans, muslims, gangstas, latinos, christians, italians, irish and more.... so scuffles, death stares, dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away. < br / > < br / > i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn ' t dare. forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences, forget charm, forget romance... oz doesn ' t mess around. the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal, i couldn ' t say i was ready for it, but as i watched more, i developed a taste for oz, and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence. not just violence, but injustice ( crooked guards who ' ll be sold out for a nickel, inmates who ' ll kill on order and get away with it, well mannered, middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience ) watching oz, you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing.... thats if you can get in touch with your darker side.",positive
"a wonderful little production. < br / > < br / > the filming technique is very unassuming - very old - time - bbc fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire piece. < br / > < br / > the actors are extremely well chosen - michael sheen not only "" has got all the polari "" but he has all the voices down pat too! you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams ' diary entries, not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece. a masterful production about one of the great master ' s of comedy and his life. < br / > < br / > the realism really comes home with the little things : the fantasy of the guard which, rather than use the traditional ' dream ' techniques remains solid then disappears. it plays on our knowledge and our senses, particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets ( particularly of their flat with halliwell ' s murals decorating every surface ) are terribly well done.",positive
"i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light - hearted comedy. the plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable ( even the well bread suspected serial killer ). while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 : risk addiction, i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love. < br / > < br / > this was the most i ' d laughed at one of woody ' s comedies in years ( dare i say a decade? ). while i ' ve never been impressed with scarlet johanson, in this she managed to tone down her "" sexy "" image and jumped right into a average, but spirited young woman. < br / > < br / > this may not be the crown jewel of his career, but it was wittier than "" devil wears prada "" and more interesting than "" superman "" a great comedy to go see with friends.",positive
"basically there ' s a family where a little boy ( jake ) thinks there ' s a zombie in his closet & his parents are fighting all the time. < br / > < br / > this movie is slower than a soap opera... and suddenly, jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie. < br / > < br / > ok, first of all when you ' re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama! as a drama the movie is watchable. parents are divorcing & arguing like in real life. and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film! i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie, and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots. < br / > < br / > 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents & descent dialogs. as for the shots with jake : just ignore them.",negative
"petter mattei ' s "" love in the time of money "" is a visually stunning film to watch. mr. mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations. this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money, power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter. < br / > < br / > this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler ' s play about the same theme, the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect. each one is connected in one way, or another to the next person, but no one seems to know the previous point of contact. stylishly, the film has a sophisticated luxurious look. we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat. < br / > < br / > the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits. a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment, as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter. < br / > < br / > the acting is good under mr. mattei ' s direction. steve buscemi, rosario dawson, carol kane, michael imperioli, adrian grenier, and the rest of the talented cast, make these characters come alive. < br / > < br / > we wish mr. mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work.",positive
"probably my all - time favorite movie, a story of selflessness, sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause, but it ' s not preachy or boring. it just never gets old, despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years. paul lukas ' performance brings tears to my eyes, and bette davis, in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles, is a delight. the kids are, as grandma says, more like "" dressed - up midgets "" than children, but that only makes them more fun to watch. and the mother ' s slow awakening to what ' s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling. if i had a dozen thumbs, they ' d all be "" up "" for this movie.",positive
"i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me. i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero ' s every week. you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt. we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure. oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies. so any ole way i believe i ' ve got what i wanna say. would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt. if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit, or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit, if this is so then i must go so lets do it.",positive
"this show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70 ' s when it first aired. the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. by 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, and it ' s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today. < br / > < br / > it ' s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen. the writing is painfully bad, the performances are almost as bad - if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest - hosts, this show probably wouldn ' t still be on the air. i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand - selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed. how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity? i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success. as it is now, the show is just awful. i can ' t believe it ' s still on the air.",negative
"encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film. bad mistake. i ' ve seen 950 + films and this is truly one of the worst of them - it ' s awful in almost every way : editing, pacing, storyline, ' acting, ' soundtrack ( the film ' s only song - a lame country tune - is played no less than four times ). the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme. rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film. < br / > < br / > the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 - score is harvey keitel - while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort. one for keitel obsessives only.",negative

"phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines. < br / > < br / > at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn ' t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore. < br / > < br / > its a low budget film ( thats never a problem in itself ), there were some pretty interesting characters, but eventually i just lost interest. < br / > < br / > i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking. < br / > < br / > for something similar but better try "" brother from another planet """,negative
"i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out. i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air. the horror. the horror. < br / > < br / > as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons, i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero, a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end. i didn ' t care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots. i love them now for the unintentional humor. < br / > < br / > but, about a year or so later, i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star, janet leigh, was bumped off early in the film. i sat up and took notice at that point. since screenwriters are making up the story, make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well - worn formula. there are no rules.",negative
"so im not a big fan of boll ' s work but then again not many are. i enjoyed his movie postal ( maybe im the only one ). boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished. < br / > < br / > people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned, that this is not far cry... this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks.. feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with. these players go by the names of til schweiger, udo kier and ralf moeller. < br / > < br / > three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz. so the tale goes like this, jack carver played by til schweiger ( yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes!! ) however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass.. people have complained about how he ' s not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don ' t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a * *.. < br / > < br / > however, the storyline in this film is beyond demented. we see the evil mad scientist dr. krieger played by udo kier, making genetically - mutated - soldiers or gms as they are called. performing his top - secret research on an island that reminds me of "" spoiler "" vancouver for some reason. thats right no palm trees here. instead we got some nice rich lumberjack - woods. we haven ' t even gone far before i started to cry ( mehehe ) i cannot go on any more.. if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience, meaning most of it will suck. < br / > < br / > there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes. until the whole cromed / albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh.. the movie far cry reeks of scheisse (",negative

"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes, only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i ' ve ever seen. sort of like a high school film project. what was rosanna arquette thinking?? and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town? pretty hard to get involved with this one. no lessons to be learned from it, no brilliant insights, just stilted and quite ridiculous ( but lots of skin, if that intrigues you ) videotaped nonsense.... what was with the bisexual relationship, out of nowhere, after all the heterosexual encounters. and what was with that absurd dance, with everybody playing their stereotyped roles? give this one a pass, it ' s like a million other miles of bad, wasted film, money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa.....",negative
"some films just simply should not be remade. this is one of them. in and of itself it is not a bad film. but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title. liam neeson was excellent as he always is, and most of the cast holds up, with the exception of owen wilson, who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke. but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it ' s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects. again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film. but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more.",positive

"an awful film! it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe. they ' ve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition. my complaint is not that they ' ve taken liberties with the facts ; if the story were good, that would perfectly fine. but it ' s simply bizarre - - by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film, so why did they come up with this dishwater - dull script? i suppose there weren ' t enough naked people in the factual version. it ' s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist ' s life - - we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they ' d favored the rest of the film with same brevity.",negative

this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards! i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film. it ' s great to see j. beals but she ' s only in the movie for a few minutes. m. parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for. the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable. the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch. there is no real emotional depth to the story. a movie revolving about an actor who can ' t get work doesn ' t feel very original to me. nor does the development of the cop. it feels like one of many straight - to - video movies i saw back in the 90s... and not even a good one in those standards. < br / > < br / >,negative

"one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist, the mafia middle - man titta di girolamo, a physically non - descript, middle - aged man originally from salerno in southern italy. when we ' re introduced to him at the start of the film, he ' s been living a non - life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian - speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years, conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to. while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo ' s cash tell him that 10, 000 dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes. at the news, he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account. meanwhile he tells us, the spectators, that when you bluff, you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous. he says : you can ' t bluff for a while and then halfway through, tell the truth. having eventually done this - bluffed only halfway through and told the truth, and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately, love - is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo ' s troubles. < br / > < br / > this initially unsympathetic character, a scowling, taciturn, curt man on the verge of 50, a man who won ' t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye, becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about. at one point in his non - life, titta decides to feel concern about appearing "" ridiculous "". the first half of the film may be described as "" slow "" by some. it does indeed reveal di girolamo ' s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined, deliberate pace, revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details. however, scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes. the existence of titta di girolamo - the man with no imagination, identity or life, the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would - is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music ( one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out ). < br",positive

"set in the 1794, the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi, this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton ( gerard depardieu, at his finest ) and robespierre ( a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak ). the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre. he is opposed to "" the reign of terror "" which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens, mainly by guillotine, who are thought to be opposed to the revolution. danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting. but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown, and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors. this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland. his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union, which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties. his previous film "" man of iron "" ( 1981 ) had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa, and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski, and that between danton and robespierre. danton / walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre / jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent. the film is based on the polish play "" the danton affair "" written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the 1930s, and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical. but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind - the - scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris.",positive

"i haven ' t read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on, but who knows, maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health. it isn ' t that this movie is necessarily bad for your health, but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie. you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i ' ve read on one hand, but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire, i get the feeling that she writes really good novels. the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history. < br / > < br / > still, stuart townsend ' s voice - over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt ' s vampire narrative ever did, and you can tell that queen of the damned ' s limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline. while interview decided to go with lace and elegance, queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously. one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places. the costumes and rock & roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack. < br / > < br / > however, i ' ll give credit where credit is due. the soundtrack is excellent. korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead. < br / > < br / > the film opens with a very cool goth - rock zoom & splice montage, but after the first ten minutes or so, the directing degenerates quickly. it ' s as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn ' t enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice. what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects. unfortunately, queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress. where are the yellow contacts? where ' s the pale blue make - up? scene after scene, i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem ' s lot and fright night when low budget was done right. < br / > < br / > there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage. props to aaliyah, and may her soul forever rest in peace",positive

"leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his 1995 movie and video guide. what film was he looking at? kid vengeance or god ' s gun are bombs. this film is a delight. it is fantastic. it is literate. it is well mounted. it is beautiful photographed, making a brilliant use of colors. right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well - done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre. the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks, 77 sunset strip, and the famous showdown in the good, the bad, and the ugly. edd byrnes, george hilton, and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work. it is too bad mr. maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved. one can only guess as to his reason. i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be. kudos belong to everyone involved in this project. this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire.",positive
"i don ' t believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the 700 club. they are today ' s equivalent to the ku klux klan of the 20th century. their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand. their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans, as well as billions of humans the world over, who don ' t happen to share their bigoted, cruel, monstrous, and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen. the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth, such as the idea of "" life after death "" or "" god "" or "" sin "" or "" the devil "" is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill, so lost are they in their fantasy. sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn ' t let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy. however, the 700 club is in a class by itself. they are truly a cult. while i believe in freedom of speech, they way they spread hatred, lies, disinformation, and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits. i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way, people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all. treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country, as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion. the 700 club though, is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of ' cult ' but due to the 700 club ' s vast wealth ( conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip ) they are above the law in this country. for those of you who have seen the movie "" the matrix "" you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth : the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes, and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them. < br / > < br / > in less civil times, the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the 700 club out",negative

"the golden door is the story of a sicilian family ' s journey from the old world ( italy ) to the new world ( america ). salvatore, a middle - aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life, persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily, take the arduous journey across the raging seas, and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk. in short, they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled. the imagery of the new world is optimistic, clever and highly imaginative. silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he ' ll be in the new world ; carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health, and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield. all of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience. the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while they ' re aboard the ship to the new world. < br / > < br / > the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness, especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within. the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world. the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive. this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left ( donkeys, goats and rabbits ) in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world. i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world ; it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit. the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world. this shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another, depicting the separation between the old and new worlds. this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar, wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise. < br / > < br / > as later contrasted to how the new",positive

"if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it, this film is actually quite entertaining. it ' s got action, adventure and romance, and one of the premiere casting match - ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles. as evident on this board, the picture doesn ' t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling. to get beyond that, one need only put aside the history book, and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction. i know, i know, that ' s hard to do when you consider custer ' s last stand at the little big horn and it ' s prominence in the history of post civil war america. so i guess there ' s an unresolved quandary with the picture, no matter how you look at it. < br / > < br / > there ' s a lot to take in here though for the picture ' s two hour plus run time. custer ' s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher, riding up as he does in full military regalia. the practical joke by sharp ( arthur kennedy ) putting him up in the major ' s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble. < br / > < br / > ironically, a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy, as in custer ' s first meeting with libby bacon, and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie ( hattie mcdaniel ). i hadn ' t noticed it before in other films, but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties, mantan moreland. so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress. with that in mind, the owl scene was a hoot too. < br / > < br / > as for flynn, it ' s interesting to note that a year earlier, he portrayed j. e. b. stuart opposite ronald reagan ' s depiction of general custer in "" santa fe trail "", both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland. in that film, reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers, while in flynn ' s portrayal here it ' s more than evident. but it doesn ' t come close to that of richard mulligan ' s take on the military hero in 1970 ' s "" little big man "". let",positive

"any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter - day peer in my opinion, respectfully. the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive : as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare, i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things. for those unacquainted with target priorities, an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here. the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing, rank and british - gaumont studios back in the day : frankly i prefer its quieter, more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over - produced hollywood movie ever could. this reminds me of powell and pressburger ' s the 49th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman, a favorite of mine. john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles, so this is clearly meant to be mr. portman ' s film but the whole cast shines. as for the title sequence, am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production ' s lovely pre - cgi gainsborough girl?",positive

"in sum, overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes! the director and co - writer says he wanted to mix genres - in this case drama and comedy. well, at least here, these two mix like vinegar and oil. to boot, the comedy is not very funny and juvenile. additionally, the film is not really realistic. liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals. i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on. eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex - lover ' s son. by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover, marriage of convenience and a nutty ex - lover. at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them - either ismael or primarily nora. to the detriment of the audience, viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael, her ex - lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital. there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed. the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub - plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball ' s chance in hell. the actors do their best and are appealing, but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing, editing and lack of focus.",negative

"recap : something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica. the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica. julian rome, a former seti - worker, is brought in to decipher the message. problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. soon the object is in the open. the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. it is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, julian decodes the signal.

"this is a very memorable spaghetti western. it has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from rosalba neri. her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she ' s not speaking. her performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top ( not that there ' s anything wrong with being over the top ). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too. < br / > < br / > the music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there ' s also lots of slick gun - play that ' s very well done. < br / > < br / > i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn ' t for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill / bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma ' s cowardly mexican sidekick. i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn ' t at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him? < br / > < br / > all that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.",positive
"the plot : michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct, and is looking for his 1st big chance. he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star. he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct. the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way. what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy. and, oh yes, there ' s romance, and a little sadness too. the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch. the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard. lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in 2008. it must be emphasized that this movie is a story 1st, not just a tribute to silent films. later years would bring similar films such as, singin ' in the rain ( 1952 ) & dick van dyke - carl reiner ' s, the comic ( 1969 ). what is special about this film, though, is recreating silent movies in 1939. we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era ( although some sound effects are included ) in glorious b & w, while the rest of the movie is in pristine color. one of the greatest in the silent era, buster keaton, who at this point was on an uphill climb, is used superbly in 2 silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game! it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well. but the real reason to watch the movie, if your a motion picture history fan, is that beyond everything else, hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett ' s film legacy. it doesn ' t take a genius to realize this movie is a "" positive "" reworking of mack sennett ' s and mabel normand ' s life. the character michael "" linnett "" connors is mack sennett, whose real name was michael sinnott. and molly, of course is mabel. sennett had the pie throwings, the bathing beauties and keystone cops. he worked with buster keaton, ben turpin ( cameo ), roscoe "" fatty "" arbuckle ( body double ) and fell in love with his leading lady. not only all that, but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well. as most film viewers today prefer sound features, those who were associated with short subjects and silents",positive

"chuck jones ' s ' rabbit seasoning ', the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy, is often considered to be the best of the three. while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons, i would have to concede that ' rabbit seasoning ' is the most finely honed script. here, the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costello ' s ' who ' s on next ' routine. as a long term daffy fan, i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines ( the famous "" pronoun trouble "" being one of the all time classics ) and does most of the work. bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer, as always, is the befuddled dupe. part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs. elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst, being shot in the face again and again, his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions. it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration "" you ' re despicable "". as intricate an example of chuck jones ' s impeccable timing as you ' ll come across, ' rabbit seasoning ' is a true classic.",positive

"joseph brady and clarence doolittle are two sailors, who have a four - day shore leave in hollywood. joe knows everything about girls and can ' t wait to see lola, while clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls. they then run into a little boy, donald martin, who has ran away in order to join the navy. they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan, who wants to be a singer. clarence wants susie to be his girl, but his shyness gets in the way. but he doesn ' t feel shy with a waitress, who comes from brooklyn, like he does. soon joe notices he ' s in love with susie. the boys are in a fix when they lie to susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don ' t even know. as they are in a fix with their feelings. george sidney ' s anchors aweigh ( 1945 ) is a great musical comedy. gene kelly is top - notch, once again, in his singing and dancing routines. frank sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from brooklyn. shy isn ' t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of frank sinatra, but he plays his part well. kathryn grayson is fantastic as susan abbott. we sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of 88. the 9 - year old dean stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor. jose iturbi does great job performing himself. it ' s magic what he does with the piano. edgar kennedy plays chief of police station. sara berner is the voice of jerry mouse. there ' s a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers. just look at kelly and sinatra performing "" we hate to leave "". it ' s so energetic.

"from director barbet schroder ( reversal of fortune ), i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class, and i recognised the leading actress, so i tried it, despite the rating by the critics. basically cool kid richard haywood ( half nelson ' s ryan gosling ) and justin pendleton ( bully ' s michael pitt ) team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them. investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie ' the hyena ' mayweather ( sandra bullock ) with new partner sam kennedy ( ben chaplin ), who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene, e. g. non - relating hairs. the plan doesn ' t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects, it is just a question of if they can sway them away. also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills, chris penn as ray feathers, r. d. call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst. d. a. al swanson. i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock ' s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing, but this film does it in a very silly way, and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable. adequate!",negative

"first, let me just comment on what i liked about the movie. the special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game. there, that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film. in fact, i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can ' t even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing. < br / > < br / > i have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the "" plot twist "" ( if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away ) where lois ' s 5 year - old son turns out to be the super - powered child of superman. when the crying super - child throws a piano at lex ' s henchman to save his mother, i almost got up and left the theater. singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super - powered illegitimate child. it ' s been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit. < br / > < br / > my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. it doesn ' t take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what ' s wrong with that. i don ' t know how many comic books brian singer has read, but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman - related projects ever again. the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. why not just have superman eat kryptonite? he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. that ' s not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re - entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground. < br / > < br / > my third major complaint has to do",negative

"overall i was rather impressed with the pilot. the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying, as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o. c but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle. < br / > < br / > bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism, existentialism, reality, death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext, there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose. here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed. i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films / television shows, which deal with the subjects i referenced, i think you will find at least something here. < br / > < br / > in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way, i especially liked how they explained where the cylon ' s belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers. < br / > < br / > the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays ' lacy rand '. while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually, together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry, at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters, but this is something i think needs work. i also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role. this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop, but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident. < br / > < br / > based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where ' caprica ' goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did.",positive

"the first cube movie was an art movie. it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented, and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn ' t understand. it was, on the non - literal level, a "" man vs. cruel nature "" plot, where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end, triumphing to face a new, indefinable world beyond man ' s petty squabbles ; a world where there were no more struggle, but peace. i rated cube a 10 out of 10, and it ' s a movie that was never meant to have any sequels. < br / > < br / > the second movie, hypercube was a massive disappointment. some of the ideas were kind of cool, but in the context of the original movie, both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning. still, for being fairly entertaining, i rated it a 5 out of 10. < br / > < br / > the third movie, cube zero, while ignoring the second, plays like a vastly inferior commercial b - movie rehash of the first, sans the symbolism. there is no "" homage "" or "" tribute "" here ; there is only ripping off. the same kind of plot, with some elements idiotically altered ( like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes - an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip - off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say ). < br / > < br / > that we see something from "" behind the scenes "" means nothing, because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment, the architects of which we hear nothing of. and, in this movie, those who get through to the exit ( like kazan did at the end of the first movie ) are just killed - where the * bleep * is the sense in that?! that ' s just flippin ' stupid. i ' m glad i didn ' t pay to see this. < br / > < br / > the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad, but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of 3 out of 10.",negative

"a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed : one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods. this is simply not true. prior to the construction of interstate 64, which bypasses the ocean view area, the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view. once the interstate was completed, ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime. this led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park, which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg. meanwhile, in the past few years, the city of norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought - after location for construction of high - end housing. < br / > < br / > it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film "" rollercoaster "". this is also untrue. footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film, but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to "" death of ocean view park "". < br / > < br / > as to the film itself, the storyline of a "" supernatural "" force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly, but somewhat typical for b - grade movies of the time. with the cast involved, there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors. i don ' t believe this film was intended to be another "" citizen kane "" ; i believe playboy was experimenting with a new non - nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into ( apparently not! ). a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table, but proved unmanageable in execution. the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway ; "" let ' s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise!

( which is unique among allen ' s work ) along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson. scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop ' s most enjoyable aspect. the plot revolves around johanson ' s character ( a journalism student ) who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave. she falls in love with a suspected serial killer ( jackman ) and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding. oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen. < br / > < br / > i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johanson ' s performance but i am a bit bias, i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted. she plays a ditsy, yappy, bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen ' s stereotypical neurosis stricken character. she adds appropriate body language for comic effect. needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johanson ' s character sickeningly cute and that is a plus. < br / > < br / > allen is allen... he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character. something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however. he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late... < br / > < br / > jackman is also enjoyable as the suave, millionaire murder suspect. i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less. < br / > < br / > in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh... in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion. johanson and allen are more detective - like than anything. however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film. instead of everything being black and white, things are painted in shades of gray. being entirely innocent has nothing",positive
"i rented this film because of my interest in american history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons. this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his "" vision "" into a major world religion. it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo, illinois. it portrays the trial of joseph smith. within the course of that trial, brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith. then smith is assassinated, and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land. despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision ( that utah is the place for his colony ) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen - - however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history. < br / > < br / > i found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised. the issue is not emphasized. < br / > < br / > i ' m sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject - matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.",positive

"although there are some snippets in this 4 - part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform, these are not very well - developed, in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs. < br / > < br / > although this program, as a whole, leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money, and for that it deserves some praise, almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to - - very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you, if asked, they think the drug war is designed to solve. for example, while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the 80 ' s, at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law, forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business. but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence, the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame. inexplicably, alcohol prohibition, the violence that ensued, and the subsequent reversal of prohibition, is totally ignored by this program. < br / > < br / > this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users, and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war. the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on. use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems, but not all users do their drugs in excess, just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics. < br / > < br / > if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government, for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science, has decided to totally prohibit, whose users it has decided to not - so - metaphorically wage war against, just forget about it. none of that is in here. < br / >",negative

"hypothetical situations abound, one - time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post - apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead, left in the streets, in the stores, and throughout the landscape, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. one lone survivor, attempting to rekindle his sanity, takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. all alone, he hopes for more, but with nobody around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for a local indian tribe until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co - existence. alan, a man of the book, is left on earth after an unknown disaster. thinking he is alone, he begins living life his way until, jeri ryan, appears ( like she would in any dream ) out of the woods, disheveled, and unhappy to find the final man alive to be... well... like alan. anyway, they try to co - exist, fail, get drunk, and before creating the ultimate dystopia, they run into redneck raphael ( played by newcomer dan montgomery jr ). bonds are torn, confusion sets in, a couple becomes a third wheel, and the battle between physically inept nerd vs. brainless jock. even with nobody left on the planet, it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise. < br / > < br / > using a variable film technique, ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled "" the quiet earth "" ( which i will be viewing next ) oddly which he never gives any credit towards. with a borrowed story, i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it. his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride, borrowing yet again from other film director ' s techniques to attempt to find his own. he opens the film interestingly enough, but fails to answer any direct answers. sure, the final days have arrived, but could there be a concise answer as to "" how "" or better yet "" why "" these select few survived. a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film. the juxtaposition would have been like "" shawn of the dead "", but instead left us feeling like we were watching a "" made - for - tv "" program. listening to the audio commentary, i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made",negative
"< br / > < br / > i must admit, i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of ' cut ' last night, though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem. i am a true horror fan as true as they come, and found ' cut ' to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced, but one of the great parody / comedy films of late. < br / > < br / > my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements - the film was not overly clever in it ' s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could. i am certain this was intended as humour.... hoping this was intended as humour. < br / > < br / > and of course, there was the gore. < br / > < br / > the use of the ' customised ' garden shears was brilliance - besides the expected stabs and slashes. in short, there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths, enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth. < br / > < br / > the appearance of both kylie minogue ( short that her appearance was ) and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film - both performances were fantastic, as well as simon bossell ( ' the castle ' ) in a brilliant role as the jokey technician. < br / > < br / > all in all, i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years, as well as a beautiful satire / parody - toungue - in - cheek till the very end. < br / > < br / > loved it. go see it!",positive
"i am so happy not to live in an american small town. because whenever i ' m shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies, evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless. in this movie a former doctor, who ' s just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash, directs his steps to the nearest small town - he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns - which happens to be the purgatory flats. and, of course, as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose. he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her. but there is a tiny handicap, she is already married to a very small - time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead. to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself. i ' ll just tell you that it ' s slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties.",positive
"like anyone else who bought this, i was duped by the "" 20 pieces of extreme gore "" and "" banned in 20 countries "" or whatever it says in the box. i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it. tom savini, rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business. the revolutionized make - up effects in the 80 ' s. today, you don ' t need them as everything is done on computer. but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up. but i digress. < br / > < br / > watching fantastically gory films like fulci ' s gates to hell or even savini ' s crowning achievement, friday the 13th the final chapter, you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film. you can ' t tell the difference between reality and magic. < br / > < br / > i can ' t imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film. if that is the reason you seek this film, then you are wasting your money. as many other reviewers in here have noted, most of the gore is an aftermath. you don ' t see the torture, or the bloodshed as it happens, you see whatever it looks like afterwords. < br / > < br / > the gore? well, it ' s here, but not as much as one would hope, or expect. a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts, but other then those two scenes, and one involving a scalping ; there is nothing really much else to this film. the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned, are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for. maybe it ' s just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre, but i was expecting a bit more. call me sick or twisted, but isn ' t that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place? i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places. < br / > < br / > cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film. while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film, it is much better than this tripe.",negative

"director don siegel really impressed me with this film. it is starkly shot, graphic without being visually graphic, well - acted by all concerned, and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike, almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer. i didn ' t know what to expect sitting down to watch this : a civil war movie or some kind of 70 ' s soft - core peddling with eastwood descending on a school for girls in the south. but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination, exploration, and descent into the soul of men and women - a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized. as one reviewer previously noted, none - none - of the characters are likable by the film ' s end and yet each one is interesting, complex, and enigmatic. eastwood plays cpl. mcburney, a union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdin ( you ' ll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it ), a girl at a school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war - particularly in the south. soon, page, teacher elizabeth hartman, lovely, young seductress carol, and even ferdin ( amy ) have emotional / sexual ties to eastwood - each having their own needs and secrets and problems. eastwood is not a nice man. he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage. in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest. the beguiled, for me, is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front. this might be ( except for invasion of the body snatchers ) siegel ' s best film. it certainly is one of eastwood ' s best real performances. page is always so very good and hartman, fe5rdin, et al excellent. the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic. some of the sexual - laced scenes disturbing. and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy, eerie, demented film.",positive

"arguably the finest serial ever made ( no argument here thus far ) about earthman flash gordon, professor zarkov, and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet. along the way, in spellbinding, spectacular, and action - packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin, prince thun, and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura ( now she ' s a car! ). this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot, acting, and budget - it is miles ahead in these areas. produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few. the production values across the board are advanced, in my most humble opinion, for 1936. the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first - rate. we get hawk - men, shark men, lion men, high priests, creatures like dragons, octasacks, orangapoids, and tigrons ( oh my! ) and many, many other fantastic things. are all of them believable and first - rate special effects? no way. but for 1936 most are very impressive. the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well - written, lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter, and expertly scored. director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex raymond ' s phenom comic strip. lastly, the acting is pretty good in this serial. all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents - here most everyone has some ability. don ' t get me wrong, this isn ' t a shakespeare troupe by any means, but buster crabbe does a workmanlike, likable job as flash. he is ably aided by jean arden, priscella lawson, and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out. but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted, it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office. i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades",positive

"i want very much to believe that the above quote ( specifically, the english subtitle translation ), which was actually written, not spoken, in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist, was meant to be self - referential in a tongue - in - cheek manner. but if so, director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film. they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here, or else has so much disdain for everyone, especially the viewing audience, that he can ' t be bothered letting anyone in on the joke. < br / > < br / > some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique, bizarre films because they do so with elan and unique personal style ( e. g., david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky ). others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story ( e. g., krzysztof kieslowski, and david cronenberg ' s later, less bizarre works ). in pola x, carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it. well, here it is : the pacing is erratic and choppy, in particular continuity is often dispensed with ; superfluous characters abound ( e. g., the gypsy mother and child ) ; most of the performances are overwrought ; the lighting is often poor, particularly in the oft - discussed sex scene ; unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason ; and the list goes on. < br / > < br / > not to be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. i liked the musical score, even the cacophonous industrial - techno music being played in the sprawling, abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film ( perhaps a reference to andy warhol ' s ' factory ' of the ' 60s? ). much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful, an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings. and, even well into middle - age, cathering deneuve shows that she still has ' it '. her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn ' t sink into bathos. < br / > < br / > there was an earlier time",negative

"if you ' ve read mother night and enjoyed it so much ( as i did ) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut ' s writing - that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself, and that you can ' t put a human mind on the screen. his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. does this mean that the movie misses the mark? of course not. in my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book ( this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page ). it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america ' s true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. i ' ve seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut ' s genius and loses grip on his own craft. i would not place this movie as one of the best i ' ve seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. by taking vonnegut ' s "" voice "" out of the movie ' s narration or trying to insert it however it can, mother night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story ' s fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.",positive

"following directly from where the story left off in part one, the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man ' s legacy is exactly as such. in direct contrast to the first feature, part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country, to chestruggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties. the change of setting isn ' t just aesthetic ; from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature, replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical, battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle. yet, as che would go on to say himselfsuch a struggle is best told exactly as thata struggle. while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that, part two takes a much more refined, callous and bleak segment of che ' s life and ambition, and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible, easy to grasp manner. < br / > < br / > while the movie ' s tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however, there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible. this somewhat distant, cold approach to telling che ' s story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off ; indeed, i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one manif anything, the entirety of che, taken as a whole, delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man ' s struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way. by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago ( excuse the ironic contrast ) ; che is a slow moving, reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who arguably - conducted the whole thing. < br / > < br / > yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak, decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two, the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn ' t feel too disjointed from its predecessor, but does enough to give it its own reference points. here, the basic structure of part one is echoed backthere ' s",positive

"the problem is the role of the characters in the film. man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film... the kidnapper ( british anthropologist ) ends up being the hero of the film because he ' manages ' to relate to the pygmies... no notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal... i find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view... it never manages to move away from the ' white mans ' view",negative
"life begins - and ends - in a typical 1930 ' s maternity / recovery ward, where we view 48 hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women, played by loretta young, glenda farrell, clara blandick ( aunty em??? ), vivienne osborne, dorothy tree, and gloria shea, as they await to give birth. while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted, it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in 1932 was like for our grandmothers and great - grandmothers. i found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving. < br / > < br / > oddly enough, the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member, young eric linden as jed sutton, grace ' s ( loretta young ) husband. what an actor! as a first time father, jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table. i felt his every concern keenly. i ' d like to see more of this actor ' s work. he had a very emotional voice, which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind. in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia, who screamed "" don ' t cut! don ' t cut! "" as scarlett fled the hospital in horror. chilling! another great performance is from aline macmahon, who plays miss bowers, the nurse. her character is a salt of the earth type, the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays, who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession. < br / > < br / > loretta young did another superb acting job here as well, a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace. my, she is great in these precodes, i ' ve really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months. < br / > < br / > glenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste ( didn ' t anyone know back in 1932 that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies ' health? ) but her character redeems herself in the end. < br / > < br / > also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland, silent",positive

"* criticism does mention spoilers * < br / > < br / > i rarely make user comments, but this is one movie i have no problem slandering. this movie stinks, and its mediocre of rating of 6 and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp. the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were, despite what its ad claims. this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller. the pace of this movie was extremely slow - i actually left for about 10 minutes half - way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression ( i refer to you the part where angelina jolie ' s character debates denzel about cutting off a corpse ' hands ). the movie is not at all scary, but tries to compensate this with a love - subplot albeit sexy angelina jolie ' s character and denzel washington ' s. of course, what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor - student relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling, however, even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two. with such a crappy movie, i was half - expecting a plot - twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit - things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off. anybody with a 4th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved ( a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock ' s rear window ). the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough, but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen. esoterically speaking, i even think the murderer ' s intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial ' chess game ' and gets with his pet project, angelina. < br / > < br / > if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts ( like i am ), you will not appreciate this film. if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch - up on every single hollywood cliche ever borne ( the late - night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer, the ridiculous serial - killer to prime investigator relationship",negative
"possible spoilers, perhaps. i must say that "" cinderella ii : dreams come true "" is one of the worst movies ever made. first of all, the movie was made during the height of disney ' s sequel rampage. it was created around the same time as "" the little mermaid ii, "" "" the jungle book ii, "" and "" peter pan ii, "" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. ( disney also made "" the hunchback of notre dame ii "" and "" atlantis ii, "" but i ' m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place.

"" the sequel to "" cinderella, "" however, was a waste of time. the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching. in the original, cinderella was kind and loving. the new cinderella had very out - of - character moments with current - era phrasing like, "" i ' m going to do this banquet my way!

"" that is the anti - cinderella. i try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! what the heck? why? they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia. my question to the world : did the people at disney watch the original "" cinderella "" when making this sequel? well, it surely doesn ' t seem so. if i remember correctly, anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine. i am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie. in the first one, anastasia was evil. in the second one, she is good. one just can ' t leave a story like this. i hope disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming walt disney ' s name. perhaps now that michael eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the house of mouse.",negative

"i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing, he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor. like many others on here, i don ' t know how to categorize this film, it wasn ' t scary or spooky so can ' t be called a horror, the plot was so wafer thin it can ' t be a drama, there was no suspense so it can ' t be a thriller, its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project. people who liked this film used words, like "" ambiguity "" and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn ' t there. like the blair witch, people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying. this movie actually started off well with the family "" meeting "" the locals after hitting a deer. it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next 45 minutes, ( well over half the film ), nothing happened, the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining. it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie. finally, when something does happen, its not even clear how the father was shot, how he dies, ( the nurse said his liver was only grazed ), and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with 3rd grade special effects. the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way, the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied, i would have bailed out with 15 minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself. it didn ' t.",negative

"having been interested in akhenaton for many years i was surprised to learn about this film via e - bay and bought a copy on dvd for 99p. i enjoyed the film, the twists and turns in the plot and that the file was mainly about the main character sinuhe makes it more of a "" family saga "" rather than an action film. the costumes and attention to detail was remarkable for its time ( 1955 ). the back projection during the chariot ride now looks clumsy. my main interest was in the character of akhenaton and his monotheistic religion. in this film he was portrayed as being "" jesus "" like in his refusal to go to war with the hittites even through they were invading egypt and in his closing speech about the futility of materiality and political power. initially one makes a connection between sinuhe, who was cast adrift in the river nile in a reed basket, and the old testament moses. but this connection is not carried no doubt this will be fully explored in a new film wherein a moses like character carries akhenaton ' s monotheistic religion out to the wider world, if such a film will ever be politically possible to make. it is universally accepted that were women are concerned we man are stupid creatures but the relationship or lack of one between sinuhe and merit, the character played by jean simmons is hard to accept. and that sinuhe, an educated physician, would be so smitten by nefer the babylonian "" femme fatal "" to the extent of giving her his adopted parents house and tomb is not really believable, neither that his parents would even have a tomb. in real life nefer ( nefertitti ) was the wife of akhenaton. and although horemheb did become pharaoh it was after a few others including tutankhamen, who was the son of akhenaton. < br / > < br / > but of course this is just nit picking and the film is enjoyable to watch and that it is about akhenaton and his monotheistic religion is a big bonus. maybe following "" the de vinci code "" book and film this film be re - made with the central secret being the foundation of our current monotheism! i wait in great anticipation of such a film, there are already numerous books on the subject.",positive

"prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there ' s a good reason for that because it ' s not one of the best... but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known / smaller films. the film does have some connection to blockbusters ; for a start it ' s an early directorial effort for renny harlin ; the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2, cliffhanger and deep blue sea ; and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen. the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison ' s governor. naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace ; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance. < br / > < br / > the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base. this is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn ' t really have a ' plot ' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it ' s never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess. the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. as the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back - story of the vengeful convict ' s ghost and while it ' s fairly interesting, some things about it don ' t make sense and it drags the film down a little. still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down.",positive

"de palma ' s technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques, though unfortunately, as with many of the films written by de palma himself, the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale. < br / > < br / > the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband. she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously near - and the whole thing is revealed to be angie ' s fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed. she has a short scene with her son, a dead ringer for harry potter, which concludes with a joke that "" she ' ll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter.

"having read many of the comments here, i ' m surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a twilight zone episode from 1960 called "" mirror image, "" starring vera miles. rod serling did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than sean ellis did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze. a short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending, but in a feature film, there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense. sadly, substance and sense are two things missing from "" the broken.

"just got around to seeing monster man yesterday. it had been a long wait and after lots of anticipation and build up, i ' m glad to say that it came through and met my expectations on every level. true, you really can ' t expect too much from hearing the plot rundown, but after reading some of the reviews for it, i was ecstatic. i mean, what trash fan wouldn ' t want to see a gore flick about a deranged inbred hick mowing people down with his make - shift monster truck? i went in expecting a cross between road trip and the hills have eyes and got so much more. this was a horror comedy that actually worked. the film makers got it right when it came to making you squirm and making you howl with laughter at the same time. kudos to michael davis for going all out with the gore and pushing the envelope with the sickass humor. let me list just a few reasons why i love this movie so much : first off is the story. it ' s been done to death in so many other flicks. a college guy gets wind that his childhood crush is getting married. he, being the 25 year old virgin that he is, hops in his vista cruiser and decides to take the road trip to confess his love, hoping that she will fall head over hills and all that good jive. hidden in the backseat of his station wagon, is good buddy harley. harley is the loudmouth, former friend, who laughs and talks just like jack black in high fidelity. you can ' t help but like the guy, but if he was your friend in real life, you ' d have to keep a whiffle ball bat handy ( laugh all you want, but have you ever been hit with one? ) to keep him in check. so, he ' s a little on the obnoxious side, to say the least, but you can tell that he ' s a loyal friend, deep down... anyway, they ' re on the road and when they stop in a bar, they aggravate the locals. now they ' re being stalked by a leatherface clone in a monster truck. that ' s it. yeah, along the way they pick up a gorgeous hitchhiker but i ' m too lazy and hungover to go into that right now... so just watch the damn movie. < br / > < br / > second thing i love was the humor. this one had some of",positive

"at first i had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this : that shots of fat people sunbathing, etc were cheap shots in a way. ok so he ' s doing diane arbus meets... whatever... but it wasn ' t long before i realized that this wasn ' t being done in a dehumanizing way, as the images unfold i felt that the problem was entirely the audience ' s : we are conditioned by hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly, something that ought not to be shown. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. however, the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks : very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and to think the scene was improvised. that blonde guy is a genius actor. finally i want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a ok character that breaks that mold, so don ' t oversimplify the film by overlooking him. yes his dog gets killed. this ain ' t a rosy picture of the world but it ' s not... completely hopeless. anyway i felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all. i wouldn ' t say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest, but i say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it...",positive

"today i found "" they all laughed "" on vhs on sale in a rental. it was a really old and very used vhs, i had no information about this movie, but i liked the references listed on its cover : the names of peter bogdanovich, audrey hepburn, john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me, the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it. i searched imdb, and the user rating of 6. 0 was an excellent reference. i looked in "" mick martin & marsha porter video & dvd guide 2003 "" and wow four stars! so, i decided that i could not waste more time and immediately see it. indeed, i have just finished watching "" they all laughed "" and i found it a very boring overrated movie. the characters are badly developed, and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story. the plot is supposed to be funny ( private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing ), but i have not laughed along the whole story. the coincidences, in a huge city like new york, are ridiculous. ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man, with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt, antonio banderas or george clooney, is quite ridiculous. in the end, the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten, murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie, and whose life was showed in "" star 80 "" and "" death of a centerfold : the dorothy stratten story "" ; the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen, the future mrs. keith richards ; the always wonderful, even being fifty - two years old, audrey hepburn ; and the song "" amigo "", from roberto carlos. although i do not like him, roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60 ' s and is called by his fans as "" the king "". i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions ( manly dorothy stratten ). my vote is four. < br / > < br / > title ( brazil ) : "" muito riso e muita alegria "" ( "" many laughs and lots of happiness "" )",negative

""" plots with a view "" of 2002 is a delightful little comedy like only the british could do it. the film ' s sense of humor is both mildly morbid and black and yet very lovable and sometimes very slapstick - ish. it ' s the only film by director nick hurran i ' ve seen so far, and while i am not intending to watch any of his other films at the moment ( i ' m not a big fan of romantic comedies ), this one is highly enjoyable and very funny. the film takes place in a little town in wales, where betty rhys - jones ( brenda blethyn ) is married to the town ' s drunken and adulterous major ( robert pugh ). the local mortician boris ( alfred molina ) has been desperately in love with betty since their childhood, but has always been too shy to confess his love to her. apart from being desperately in love, boris has some other problems, as the eccentric american mortician frank featherbed ( christopher walken ) has opened a funeral flourishing business in the same town... the film ' s odd, very british wit should amuse everybody with a sense of humor, and the story sometimes becomes quite bizarre. also, "" plots with a view "" profits from a wonderful cast. brenda bethlyn, who has already proved herself to be a funny lady in 2000 ' s "" saving grace "", plays the lead, and she is once again very funny, and very lovable in her role. alfred molina, who plays her shy admirer, delivers a great performance as always, and robert pugh fits perfectly in the role of betty ' s sleazy husband. beautiful naomi watts is also great as the husband ' s ' secretary ', i ' m becoming a bigger fan with every film i see her in. the greatest role, however, is played by the incomparable christopher walken ( one of my favorite actors ). walken is brilliant as he always is in the role of the eccentric mortician who arranges funerals that are quite unorthodox. overall, "" plots with a view "" is a vastly entertaining little british comedy that i highly recommend!",positive

"seeing this film, or rather set of films, in my early teens irrevocably changed my idea of the possibilities of human interaction and the range of potential experience. this monumental exploration of individuals, and their historical setting, reveals how full bodied and intense every human existence is. the people are portrayed as they are to themselves : their experiences of the smallest to the largest internal and external phenomena are detailed with the greatest of artistry and perception. edgar reitz displays a fabulous appreciation of human motivations and longings. < br / > < br / > when these phenomena are set against the immense time allowed by the length of the work, one cannot help but apprehend the force and vivacity of happiness, defeat, lust, love, sadness, melancholy, that each person feels. when i saw these films i perceived my future experiences, how my life would inevitably twist and oscillate due to both intended and accidental events. i acquired a feeling of the longevity of being and what it meant to reflect upon past lives, memories and contexts. a masterpiece and a revelation. i only wish the bbc would screen it again. < br / > < br / > if anyone knows where i can get a copy, could they contact me",positive

"walt disney ' s 20th animated feature was the last one to be greenlighted by the great man himself ( he died in late 1966 ) and is not generally considered to be among their very best output. the main problem is that, on the surface, the film seems merely to be the feline version of either lady and the tramp ( 1955 ) or 101 dalmations ( 1961 ) both of which are certainly more beloved by fans even so, being both an animation and cat lover, i dug this reasonably bouncy concoction in which a pampered female cat ( voiced by eva gabor ) and her three little kittens are thrown out onto the streets of paris by a wealthy lady ( hermione baddeley ) ' s greedy butler. luckily, they meet a streetwise alley cat ( phil harris ) who guides them on the journey back and are further aided along the way by a feline jazz band ( led by scatman crothers ) and two helpful and amiably dopey dogs ; meanwhile at home, edgar the butler celebrates his supposed inheritance and the mouse and the horse do their bit to help their fellow feline pets. legendary entertainer maurice chevalier was whisked back from retirement to sing the title song ( which includes a verse in french ) and scatman ' s band indulge in a breezy number "" ev ' rybody wants to be a cat "".",positive

"some unsuspecting films carry a message that resonates in the hours and days after viewing. such is the case for carol ' s journey ( el viaje de carol ), a beautifully crafted 2002 film from spain based on the novel ' a boca de noche ' by angel garcia roldan who also adapted the book as a screenplay. war and its consequences are not new subject matter for films, but when that war theme plays in the background as a subtle driving force to develop characters ( especially children ) who must face adult life influenced by the games of adults, the result is a different and more tender examination of the coming of age film genre. < br / > < br / > carol ( clara lago ) is a 12 - year - old spanish american youngster from new york who with her critically ill mother aurora ( maria barranco ) returns to her aurora ' s home in 1938 at the height of the spanish civil war, a home that has been left deserted by her father don amalio ( alvaro de luna ) since his wife ' s death. carol ' s father robert ( ben temple ) is a fighter pilot who has sided with the republicans against franco and is rarely with his family. aurora has a past : she left her lover alfonso ( alberto jimenez ) to marry robert, and alfonso in turn married aurora ' s cold sister dolores ( lucina gil ). carol is an independent girl who remains aloof to all but her grandfather don amalio until she meets others her age but not of her ' class ' : tomiche ( juan jose ballesta ) and his two friends at first resent carol, but as events develop carol and tomiche are bonded by what feels like the first awakenings of love. when aurora dies of her illness, carol must live with alfonso and dolores and their daughter blanca ( luna mcgill ), yet turns to her grandfather for support and to her mother ' s best friend and teacher maruja ( the always radiant rosa maria sarda ) to understand the disparity between classes and the senseless war that keeps her beloved father from her side. through a series of incidents carol and tomiche learn the rigors of becoming adults, facing more traumas in a brief period of the war than most of us experience in a lifetime. the ending, though sad, is uplifting as carol ' s journey to maturity is complete. < br / > < br / > the film is shot in galicia and portugal and contains some extraordinarily beautiful settings captured with gentle sensitive lighting",positive
"road to perdition can be summed up by thomas newman ' s score. it ' s haunting and beautiful but you ' re aware that this music is similar to newman ' s other work and while listening to the soundtrack you ' re reminded of scent of a woman, meeting joe black and the shawshank redemption you ' re reminded of other films as the story unfolds on screen. as the sullivans drive round america trying to escape from a psychotic hit man you think of the getaway, irish gangsters is miller ' s crossing whilst the subtext of guilt and redemption can be summed up by coppola and leone ' s gangster epics. despite having a seen it all before feel this shouldn ' t be taken as a heavy criticism of sam mendes film which i repeat is haunting and beautiful and the only flaws that work against it is a very slow opening twenty minutes and i was slightly confused as the events that caused michael sullivan to be betrayed. but if you stop to consider how much of a sentimental mess spielberg might have made with the story that revolves around a father and his twelve year old son running for their lives you can ' t help thinking what a superb director mendes is < br / > < br / > road to perdition is a film where the entire cast give flawless performances. i ' ve never been all that keen on tom hanks but he ' s every bit as good here as he has been in any starring role, probably better. paul newman plays a character with an irish accent but at no point did i believe i was watching an american screen legend putting on a false accent - newman ' s performance works due to the subtle body language, his character is torn up by guilt but newman never milks it or goes over the top. while never upstaging newman who gives the best performance in the movie the two brit supporting actors craig and law are also very memorable as american gangsters and while law will still have a long career as a leading actor one wonders how daniel craig might have progressed as a character actor if he hadn ' t decided to become james bond, a role which heralds the end of an actors career",positive

( look at many of the above comments that state "" well i haven ' t read the book or anything by this author... ) their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the scifi channel. they are extremely uncritical, willing to overlook huge plot holes, weak premises, and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects. they are, in effect, willing to turn off their critical thinking skills ( or maybe they never had them! ) for the duration of the movie. case in point, i robot. while supposedly based on asimov ' s short stories and named after one of his novels, it contains little of what asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations.

"as a westerner watching another culture ' s view and tradition of marriag, i found just married mesmerizing and delightful. the idea of marrying a stranger through the mutual arrangement of parents is difficult, especially in this modern age. yet this is the case in this hindi film. told with humor, and fresh perspective, we learn of abhay and ritika who have only met once and are now on their traditional five day honeymoon. as said, it is difficult to believe in this cell phone affluent age that such an archaic custom as an arranged marriage still take place. we see the awkwardness that this young couple feels as they come together on their first night, and how they try to forge a bond, even though they do not know one another. we see different views of marriage and commitment as presented by the other couples also on holiday, from a couple of forty years married to others still unsure of making marital commitment. there ' s song, witty dialog, poignant moments, blending and comparison of new ways and tradition. watching the movie with subtitles definitely loses some of the trueness of the story, yet it is still a delight to watch. granted some of the plot is a little trite and the bus incident a bit drawn out and contrived ; however the overall movie was worth watching.",positive

"the movie with its single set, minimal cast, and straightforward photography ( except for a couple of brief special effects ) reminds me of one of those old 60 minute playhouse dramas so popular during tv ' s early years. nonetheless, the suspense hangs heavy over poor war widow ida lupino as she tries to deal with her semi - psychotic handyman robert ryan before one of his mood - swings kills her. and who better to play the troubled part than that great actor ryan. he wasn ' t very versatile - - watching him essay comedy is almost painful. but no one was better at wounded idealism ( on dangerous ground ) or the psychic pain of this movie. few actors could express as much with their eyes as this lean and towering figure. < br / > < br / > lupino ' s problem is that she ' s locked up in her house with a man who is kind and gentle one moment and raging the next. the suspense comes from her various ploys to keep him happy while trying to escape. it ' s a nail - biter all the way. this is not one of lupino ' s many fine "" soulful "" parts that she was so good at. instead, it ' s a role many lesser actresses could have handled well enough. my favorite scene is with ryan and bratty teenager margaret whiting. ryan ' s already having difficulty with his masculinity and what others are saying about him. then when whiting walks in and finds the attractive - looking ryan scrubbing the floor, she starts getting coy, flirting with her budding sexuality. sensing trouble, ryan abruptly fends her off - - finesse is not his strong suit. insulted, whiting attacks his masculinity by calling his work "" women ' s work "". that does it. up to that point he ' s been courteous and professional with lupino, trying to set himself on a normal path. but whiting has hit his raw nerve. now there ' s heck to pay as whiting bounces out the door, leaving lupino to pay the price. it ' s a riveting scene, expertly done. < br / > < br / > anyway, this is one of the dozen or so films produced by lupino and her husband at a time when audiences were moving away from these little black - and - whites in favor of wide - screen spectacles. too bad. what a hugely talented figure she was both behind the camera",positive
"this movie suffers from the fact that for years hollywood had no clue as to how to package jackie chan for the masses. his low - budget hong kong movies were all fast - paced kinetic thrillers that highlight his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. his early hollywood films stuck him in the same movies that were being packaged for stallone or chuck norris. there is nothing about chan ' s character in this movie that requires the character to be asian except for his being the star. in his hong kong films chan is never dull, with the movies being one rapid - fire martial arts sequence after another, but "" the protector "" is lifeless throughout. danny aiello isn ' t given much to work with either and the lacking chemistry between the two probably is more a result of the script and direction than how the two actors got on together. both have been better in worse movies. the best thing about the movie is the hong kong settings. the worst part is the appalling way that jackie chan comes off so colorless and drab. it wouldn ' t be until the made - in - canada "" rumble in the bronx "" that the west would finally figure out how to make a good jackie chan movie.",negative

"ordinarily, anthony mann made westerns with ' the big guys ' - james stewart, gary cooper, henry fonda... the a list cowboy stars. but in this b + film, he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western. the main character, played by victor mature, is a trapper / mountain man, and ordinarily they are romanticized in films - robert redford in jeremiah johnson, that sort of thing, where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men. not here. for once, a true mountain man - vulgar, crude, animalistic - is the central figure, and it ' s something to see, giving mature one of his better later roles. the real acting chops are provided by robert preston, excellent as a self - absorbed custer type cavalry commander, and james whitmore, the poor man ' s spencer tracy, as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other. even more impressive is a very young anne bancroft as the officer ' s wife, who is initially repulsed by the very sight of mature ' s grisly character, then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize, to her own shock, that she ' s attracted to him. rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen, without the romantic allure that john ford gave such a place in his masterful fort apache. the battle sequences are big scale and notably violent, and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format. good show, and underrated movie, all around.",positive

"i thoroughly enjoyed this film, which in many ways, as hitchcock did on several occasions, was a first attempt at a plot which he re - shot later in his career. possibly the most amazing thing about it, however, is how faceless the lead characters are. after watching, one remembers murray alper as the jovial truck driver, vaughan glaser ' s touching turn as a blind "" patriot "", the unforgettable traveling freak show and of course otto kruger as the suave and sophisticated villain, all of whom completely overshadow bob cummings as the rather wooden fugitive ( compare that bridge jump to harrison ford ' s similar stunt in andrew davis ' "" the fugitive "" ) and priscilla lane whose change of heart and subsequent love towards cummings is never quite believable. < br / > < br / > the other major support player is, of course, hitchcock himself who bookends the film with 2 extraordinary stunts. many people criticise the older films for their lack of realistic special effects. my feelings are that with lack of technology, to even attempt and convey what the director wants to show is an amazing achievement. < br / > < br / > obviously this film carries an anti - fascist message, made at the time of the second world war, but being a hitchcock it is never the most important thing and the emphasis is always on the action. well worth checking out, especially for the support roles.",positive
"man, i really wanted to like these shows. i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these "" opportunites "". but, sadly, i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king. as brilliant as king ' s writing is, the irony is that it simply doesn ' t translate well to the screen, big or small. with few exceptions ( very few ), the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. many people would disagree with this, but i ' m sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read. the reason is simple. the average king story takes place in the mind - scape of the characters in the story. he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. in short, king takes the reader places where you can ' t put a panavision camera. as an audience watching the filmed king, we ' re left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. it ' s not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read, whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. for as long as king writes, hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. i don ' t blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works. the task is akin to turning lead into gold, or some arcane zen mastery. oh well, better luck next time.",negative

"lucio fulci made a lot of great films throughout his career and the way that many of them featured a bucket load of gore lead to him earning the title ' the godfather of gore '. while don ' t torture a duckling was made before fulci became well known amongst gorehounds, and isn ' t all that gory ; it ' s certainly a gritty and nasty little thriller, and for my money - the best film that fulci ever made! don ' t torture a duckling really is head and shoulders above a lot of the giallo genre in terms of production values and unlike many of fulci ' s later films, everything about this giallo is great. the plot focuses on a small rustic community where dead bodies have began turning up. the murders are even more shocking because the victims are just young boys. shortly after the police convict an innocent man of the crimes, a reporter named andrea martelli arrives in the village and decides to start investigating the murders on his own. martelli soon encounters various suspects, including a sexy young lady named patricia, a sinister priest and a local witch who enjoys making wax effigies and sticking pins into them. < br / > < br / > while this film may not feature loads of gore, it does have two of fulci ' s nastiest sequences to make up for it. the nastiest involves a woman being brutally slaughtered by a group of men in a cemetery, while the image of a man falling from a cliff and hitting any number of rocks on the way down is liable to turn some stomachs. don ' t torture a duckling features an absolutely great italian cast. barbara bouchet ( a personal favourite of mine ) is incredibly sexy in her role as patricia, and gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in many later films. tomas millian is excellent as usual while the rest of the cast is well fleshed out by likes of irene pappas, florinda bolkan and marc porel. the cinematography on display is stunning and fulci really gives the viewer the impression that he puts a lot of care and effort into every scene. the story plays out slowly, and it ' s always interesting as fulci never allows the film to stray too much from the central plot line. there isn ' t a great deal of mystery towards the identity of the murderer ; but fulci almost manages to keep us guessing right up until the end and don ' t torture a duck",positive

"the white warrior is definitely one of, if not steve reeves weakest films. set in 18th or 19th century russia (?? ) steve plays a cossack warrior who tries to over run a mad man russian czar by running up a mountain side with his rebel band in a goofy looking russian white tunic..... for the most part the great reeves physique is hidden in a goofy, knee length tunic, with an even more sillier looking russian hat. < br / > < br / > the action is rather minimal, with only a good wrestling scene from the mid waist up that shows off the great reeves physique. this is an apparent attempt by the producers to move reeves out of the sword and sandal genre into another historic era, with poor results. the dialogue from the script is hard to understand at various points, and only commentary from the narrator allows the viewer to understand what is really happening from scene to scene. i would image reeves regretted making this film, but in an attempt to try and get out of his toga and sandals and tribune armor it helped launch him to other historic characters such as morgan the pirate and the thief of baghdad.",negative

"beware, my lovely is an experimental studio film from the early fifties and was directed by a man, harry horner, better known for his set designs. robert ryan plays a handyman who is hired by ida lupino to do some housework for her. the problem is that he is a psychopathic murderer and doesn ' t know it. miss lupino is an empathetic soul and tries to win ryan over, to little avail. he is not the sort of man compassion could help or cure. thus we have an interesting situation of two people who basically mean well, but one of them can ' t do well because there is something wrong with him. he suffers periodic blackouts during which he commits acts of violence, which he later forgets. < br / > < br / > essentially the effect ryan has on lupino is that of the hunter and his prey, or in another sense a sadist. the audience finds out early on that ryan is a mad killer, but it takes lupino much longer. thus we must live with this knowledge as we watch poor miss lupino try everything in her power to ' win ' ryan over in order to make things work, get the job done, get on with life. but getting on with things isn ' t in ryan ' s makeup, as he is incapable of any but the most rudimentary forms of normality, and as soon as there is an opening his paranoia asserts itself. < br / > < br / > as a study in mental illness the movie isn ' t too impressive. what it ' s superlative at is showing the effect of major mental illness, with dangerous psychopathology in the mix, and its effect on a normal person. in this regard the film is realistic and compassionate, though relentlessly logical in that we know lupino can ' t ' fix ' ryan, yet we want her to. the result is that, if one is willing, one can get extremely involved in this film emotionally if one can put aside, so to speak, its melodramatic structure. < br / > < br / > horner shows us, gradually, the layout the lupino house, a forbidding gothic monstrosity that never feels like a home. we become familiar with staircase, kitchen and pantry ; and we come to know which windows miss lupino can use for an escape and which ones she can ' t.",positive

"still the definitive program about the second world war, the world at war isn ' t just long, but also very informative. the series contains 26 episodes ( each episode lasts for about 45 min. ), and includes the events leading up to and following in the wake of the war. most episodes are about the war in europe, and there are several episodes about the war in the pacific. other episodes include information about the wars in africa, burma, the atlantic and the home fronts of germany, great britain, united states and soviet union. there is one episode that ' s dedicated to the holocaust. the series starts off with the episode a new germany ( 1933 - 1939 ), and tells about the rise of the nazis in germany and german territorial gains prior to the outbreak of war. the series ends with the episode remember ; the war ' s influence in a post - war world. remember is a fitting episode to end this great program. every episode begins with a short introduction and then with opening credits. the credits are accompanied by a powerful music theme. there are many fitting music pieces throughout the series. each episode is like a mini - film. the footage is fantastic, and so is the way it was put together. in addition, some of the footage is in color. the information included also makes the episodes memorable and entertaining. < br / > < br / > the series was produced by jeremy isaacs for thames television ( uk ). commissioned in 1969, it took four years to produce, such was the depth of its research. the series was narrated by laurence olivier ( one of the most famous and revered actors of the 20th century ). the series interviewed leading members of the allied and axis campaigns, including eyewitness accounts by civilians, enlisted men, officers and politicians, amongst them albert speer, karl donitz, jimmy stewart, bill mauldin, curtis lemay, lord mountbatten, alger hiss, toshikazu kase, arthur harris, charles sweeney, paul tibbets, traudl junge and historian stephen ambrose. jeremy isaacs says in "" the making of the world at war "" that he sought to interview, not necessarily the surviving big names, but their aides and assistants. the most difficult subject to locate and persuade to be interviewed, according to isaacs, was heinrich himmler ' s adjutant, karl wolff. the latter admitted to witnessing a large - scale execution in himmler ' s presence. < br / > < br / > the world at war is",positive

"as someone who has read the book, i can say that this is vastly inferior to the big american version starring gwyneth paltrow. there are various reasons for this. firstly, emma is too unpleasant. yes, she has faults, and isn ' t the easiest person to like - but the viewer shouldn ' t downright start to despise her. secondly, mr knightly is miscast. his brooding and melancholy in this version are better suited to a bronte or gaskell adaptation than austen, and throw the mood of the whole affair "" off "". thirdly, samantha morton is too strong an actress to be relegated to the role of harriet ; and why was she made to look so sickly? harriet is supposed to be blonde and blooming - not to look as if she ' s going to be carried off by consumption in the next scene. fourthly, the structure has been mucked up and scenes cut. at the end, when emma decides she loves mr knightly, it comes across as utterly baffling because this narrative hasn ' t been adequately shown and carried along throughout the film. fifthly, what was going on, exactly, with mrs elton ' s accent? she went from sounding like an american actress trying to suppress her own accent at the beginning, to all out american half - way through, and then back to english at the end. finally, this dragged at the end. the book and the big film version end with the wedding of emma and mr knightly. this version drags on confusingly after the announcement of the wedding without actually showing us the ceremony. < br / > < br / > all in all, a rather haphazard attempt. read the book or rent the paltrow version instead",negative
"i ' m not a huge fan of lucio fulci ' s films. most of his 80s gore films had their moments, but often came across as second - rate dario argento imitations. with the exception of the entertaining "" zombi "" ( which was a george romero imitation ), i didn ' t really enjoy them. i know italian horror often disregards the plot, but the storyline and characters in his films were just far too thread bare even by the standards. this is why "" don ' t torture a duckling "" surprised me. its actually a very well made film with an engrossing murder mystery. its possibly the best giallo ever made, only seriously rivaled by dario argento ' s entries into the genre. and unlike fulci ' s previous giallo "" a lizard in a woman ' s skin "", this never drags. < br / > < br / > fulci ' s direction here is quite good. he keeps the story moving at a good pace and maintains the viewer ' s interest throughout. also, the conclusion to the mystery comes as a complete surprise to the audience. plus, he adds some clever touches, such as the upbeat soul music during a particularly disturbing graveyard beating sequence. overall, the violence here is restrained and only used when necessary for the story. the acting is good for the most part also, full of familiar faces from 70s italian exploitation cinema. both thomas milian and barbara bouchet are super cool throughout. the only weak link is florinda bolkan, whose performance is just far too over - the - top. its the only laughable aspect of the film.

"the original female convict scorpion is an all time masterpiece. the first sequel, jailhouse 41, was not quite as good in my opinion, though it ' s still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style. director shunya ito has managed to do the same thing again with this film ; the story is a bit different here, but still he ' s managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it. again the action focuses on nami matsushima ( a. k. a.

"first of all, we know that bruce willis is a good actor but if you take the majority of his movies you ' ll see that the characters have these moments where they are the same. his character in this movie is far beyond every single one so far... and counting. the story begins in the ( not so far ) future where a man is sent to the past to find the source of a virus that has swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. the story seems to go towards sf but i think its closer to a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. about that. movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and develop more towards the end than the beginning but as you see this movie you ' ll be aware of this constant rhythm of story and revealing facts that does not speed up nor slow down. its the one and the same speed that flows gently and pretty good. but that doesn ' t mean that the ending wont pull your nerves, cause its pretty good. as far as the direction goes, it is prefect. movies as such are easily destroyed by bad directing but this one has become far better. so, if you are getting ready to see a sci - fi movie or some action, you ' ll miss it. b there should be more movies like this.",positive
"the basic plot of ' marigold ' boasts of a romantic comedy wherein the film industry is kept as a backdrop. an american actress marigold, played by ali carter gets stuck in india. worse that, she is out of money. she then decides to play a small role in a bollywood musical, so that she can earn enough money to get back to her nation. here she gets to meet indian choreographer prem, played by salman khan. basically, the movie fails at the script level. just by calling a film a hollywood venture doesn ' t guarantee quality cinema. marigold stands out as the best example. the art direction is weak and outdated. musically, marigold turns out to be a dud. shankar - ehsaan - loy ' s is far from being acknowledged as a decent hear. actingwise, salman delivers of his most amateurish performances till date. ali larter is good and has immense screen presence. performance wise too, she is good. < br / > < br / > one can also find good reviews regarding this movie at http : / / www. comingsoon. net / films. php? id = 36310",negative

"the cell ( 2000 ) rating : 8 / 10 < br / > < br / > the cell, like antz, must be watched twice to be appreciated. the first time i saw this film i thought it was mediocre, but the film had such a lasting impression on me after viewing, i decided i had to rent it again. i did, and i found the film to be much more likeable. the cell is not for everyone, but it divides its stories up with quality and is a visually intelligent film that dreams up images and plot ideas that could not be matched. the film ' s script can be clunky at times, as can the acting, but the visuals are ingenious and bring the engaging story to an exotic and intriguing life. the oscar nominated makeup is also daring and careful, while the beautiful costumes and utterly brilliant set decoration went unnoticed. tarsem singh who has also directed music videos, goes totally crazy with his direction and it results well. he has major talent and this film has a lot of potential if you give it a chance. overall, the cell is a powerful, disturbing and avoids being too tacky which makes it a great, pleasurable watch.",positive
"this movie, despite its list of b, c, and d list celebs, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. the plot, with its few peaks, was very predictable. it was so silly that i cannot believe that i am taking the time to even write a review of it. flex, to his credit, has grown in his ability to act since playing michael jackson in a made for tv movie a few years ago. tangi, on the other hand, has regressed, as she was more talented in her role as felicity ' s flunkie some years ago. as i sat watching this train wreck of a film, with its pitiful production and horrible sound quality, other four letter words came to my mind to qualify what i thought of this film. however, in an effort to keep my writings g rated, i ' ll simply say this film is another four letter word starting with an l. lame!!!",negative
"i loved this movie! it was all i could do not to break down into tears while watching it, but it is really very uplifting. i was struck by the performance of ray liotta, but especially the talent of tom hulce portraying ray ' s twin brother who is mentally slow due to a tragic and terrible childhood event. but tom ' s character, though heartbreaking, knows no self pity and is so full of hope and life. this is a great movie, don ' t miss it!!",positive
"this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in. i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers, who did pretty good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not believable. < br / > < br / > with all of the gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened. even the coin being a bug on sean was stupid. the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug, was not realistic. < br / > < br / > looks like this movie was slapped together fast. poor job. get a better writer. < br / > < br / > the count down to the end was not in sync with anything. it took longer to fight. and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean, he ' d be out of bullets. once, i can believe, but not twice. < br / > < br / > actually, billy ' s character was goofy. it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end. it was like a comedy. bad! bad! bad!",negative
